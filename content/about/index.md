I'm a graduate student at Changsha University of Science and Technology, currently engaged in research on data-driven industrial equipment fault diagnosis.

I have a solid theoretical foundation and extensive practical experience in fields such as machine learning and data mining. I am proficient in commonly used programming languages and tools such as Python, MATLAB, TensorFlow, and can flexibly apply them to data processing and model building.

In the past research and practice, I have participated in multiple projects, including fault diagnosis, fault prediction, anomaly detection, etc., accumulating rich experience. My research results have been published in multiple international conferences and journals and have been recognized by peers in the industry.

I have a strong passion and pursuit for academic research, dedicated to applying my research results to practical production and industrial applications, and making contributions to society. I hope to continuously improve my research level and practical ability through continuous learning and practice, and become an excellent engineer and scholar.

Thank you for reading. If you have any further questions or needs, please feel free to contact me at any time.
